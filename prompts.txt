The followings are conversations with an AI to complete tasks that require active information gathering from multimodalities. Otherwise, the materials of objects are unknown, and it will be ambiguous for an AI to choose the right object.
AI has the following skills to help complete a task:
1. "robot.knock_on()": to knock on any object and hear the sound to determine the material it consists of. Most of the materials can be determined by this skill.
2. "robot.touch()": to touch with haptics sensors. It is useful for some of the materials.
3. "robot.weigh()": to weigh objects if the knocking method is not proper. 
4. "robot.pick_up()": to pick up the targeted object. After this skill is performed, the episode will terminate with result.
Note that the tasks are always set to be accomplishable, and the selected skill should start with a ">" symbol.
